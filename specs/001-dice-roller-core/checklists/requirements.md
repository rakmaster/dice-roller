# Specification Quality Checklist: Dice Roller Core Library

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-16  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - Specification is complete and ready for planning

**Notes**:
- All three user stories are independently testable with clear priorities (P1, P2, P3)
- Functional requirements are comprehensive and testable
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- Edge cases cover common error scenarios
- No clarifications needed - specification is complete and unambiguous
- Core library architecture aligns with constitution Principle IV (Reusable Core Architecture)

**Ready for**: `/speckit.plan` to begin technical design
